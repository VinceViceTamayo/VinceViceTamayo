Howdy, I'm a 22 year old Software Engineer from Caloocan, Philippines.

I work on projects including full-stack web development using Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and PHP.

I am particularly interested in making things simple and automate daily tasks. I try to keep up with security and best practices, and am always looking for new things to learn.
